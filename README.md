# clan-lord-client-issues

This repository is used for tracking bugs in the 'modern' macOS Clan Lord client ('Clieunk').

> The actual code for the client is in a separate repository.  If you'd like to collaborate on it, please contact Skirwan.

## Reporting a Bug

Click the 'issues' link up above to view open issues; there's a 'new issue' button on that page to create a new one.

Please try doing a quick search before creating an issue -- a minute spent on bug report triage is a meant *not* spent
fixing bugs.  In the same vein -- if you're not sure whether something is a bug or not, pop over to the Clieunk Slack
and talk about it in `#bugs`.

The issues that are tagged with `imported` were automatically imported from the `#bugs` channel -- they all need to be
reviewed, cleaned up, and un-tagged.
