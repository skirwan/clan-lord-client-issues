Bug tracking for Clieunk!

Click the 'issues' link up above to view open issues; there's a 'new issue' button on that page to create a new one.

Please try doing a quick search before creating an issue -- a minute spent on bug report triage is a meant *not* spent
fixing bugs.  In the same vein -- if you're not sure whether something is a bug or not, pop over to the Clieunk Slack
and talk about it in `#bugs`.

The issues that are tagged with `imported` were automatically imported from the `#bugs` channel -- they all need to be
reviewed, cleaned up, and un-tagged.

> The code in here is the ugly script I used to import everything from the Slack we *had* been using; feel free to make
> use of it if you'd like.
